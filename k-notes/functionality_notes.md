## Functionality Description for the Debugger

### Have the debugger implement an observer pattern.

* The debugger should implement something like an **observer pattern**, which allows the user to see only the relevant parts of the configuration. This part needs more discussion and clarification.

* It's understandable that the debugger should allow for multiple instances, each supporting a different frontend. Hence, an api, or something like a debugger api should be designed. Design decision should be made keeping in mind the fact that the api should support GUIs.
